# Scientific Inquiry (FMI) - experimental design session

Material for the experimental design session of the FMI Scientific Inquiry course. 

To archive the material for a given year: 

* Create a folder with the name of the year
* Copy the HTML files (e.g. `index.html`, `design_matrices.html`, `expdesign_practical.html`) and the pdf slides to the folder
* Make a new subfolder of the archive folder named `slides`
* Copy the `css` folder into this subfolder
* Copy the `expdesign_lecture.html` file into the subfolder, and rename it `index.html`
* Add a section in the GitHub Actions yaml to copy the archive folder to `_site` for deployment
* Add a link in the bottom of `index.Rmd` (and rerender `index.html`)
